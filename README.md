# Data-Analysis-Project
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a banking dataset to identify patterns and predict whether customers are likely to leave the bank. The analysis applies advanced data preprocessing techniques and machine learning models to achieve robust predictions.
## Key Techniques
+ SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique): Used to address class imbalance by generating synthetic examples for the minority class, ensuring balanced training data.
+ PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Employed for dimensionality reduction to simplify the dataset while retaining important features, enhancing model efficiency and interpretability.
## Models
+ Random Forest: A robust ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
+ Gradient Boosting: A powerful boosting technique that builds models iteratively to correct errors of previous models, providing high predictive performance.
## Objectives
+ Identify factors influencing customer churn.
+ Build predictive models to classify customers as churned or non-churned.
+ Evaluate model performance and provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
